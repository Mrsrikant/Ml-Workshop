Wine Quality Detector
A wine quality prediction model uses machine learning to evaluate and predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties like acidity, pH, alcohol content, and sugar levels. Trained on historical data, the model identifies patterns that correlate chemical attributes with quality ratings. This tool aids winemakers in optimizing production and helps consumers select wines aligned with their preferences.
